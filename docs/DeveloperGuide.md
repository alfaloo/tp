### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of MediCLI and the various components.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `addpatient`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` (`Doctor` or `Patient`) and `Appointment` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="450"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `AddDoctorCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddDoctorCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a doctor).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` derivative objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and
* all `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueAppointmentList` object) stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query, either a `Patient` or `Doctor` instance) and `Appointment` object (e.g results of an query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model` such as `Appointment` and `Patient`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. 

The section is structured as follows:
- We first dive into the implementation of the `Appointment` - a special entity type that MediCLI tracks.
- We then explore what happens when the `execute` method of different types of `Commands` is called.
- Finally, we look at how MediCLI deals with incorrect user inputs for operations on both `Persons` and `Appointments`

Through this, we hope to give you a thorough overview of how MediCLI's main features are implemented.

### Understanding `Appointments`: A new entity type
MediCLI offers support for appointments, represented by the `Appointment` class on top of existing support for Doctors and Patients.
At the crux of it, the `Appointment` class aims to reflect the essence of a medical appointment in real life, which involves a doctor and a patient and takes place at a specific time.

The class diagram below displays the structure of the `Appointment` class.
<img src="images/AppointmentClassDiagram.png" width="800" />

As visible, the `Appointment` class contains references to the following classes:
- **`Nric`**: a doctor's & a patient's NRIC number
- **`AppointmentDateTime`**: Date and time of the appointment

The appointment class must have reference to exactly 2 `Nric` objects and 1 `AppointmentDateTime` object.

Below is an object diagram demonstrating a possible appointment object.
<img src="images/AppointmentObjectDiagram.png" width="800" />

In the object diagram you see that two instances of the Nric class have been instantiated, one as `doctorNric`, and one as `patientNric`. This of course is along with the `appointmentDateTime`.

An instance of the `Appointment` class can only be created if the date & time of the appointment is >= the current date and time. This is enforced through the `isValidAppointmentDateTime` method in the `Appointment` class.

#### Context and thought process behind implementation:
Implementing `Appointments` naturally involved many design decisions, and here we have attempted to outline the thought process behind our current implementation:
* One key focus of the `Appointment` implementation was to keep it as similar to the implementation of `Patients` and `Doctors`.
* The idea is that at the end of the day, the `Appointment` is simply another type of entry being tracked.
* Nevertheless, it is natural that both in the UI and backend, we would want to differentiate the `Appointment` entries from the `Patient`/`Doctor` entries to ensure that the system is more flexible and easy to expand on in the future.
* Hence, while similar in terms of the functionality, a lot of the infrastructure to handle `Appointments` was built parallel to the one for `Patient`/`Doctor` entries.
  * For instance, there is a separate `UniqueAppointmentList` class for storing and manipulating `Appointments` that functions very similar to the equivalent list for `Patient`/`Doctor` entries (`UniquePersonList`).

#### Implementation and justification:
* Based on the thought process, the approach taken was to ensure MediCLI had the same way of handling `Appointments` and `Patients`/`Doctors`.
* The overall structure including how `Appointments` are stored, managed etc. is largely similar to support debugging and improve readability and comprehension.
* In other words, if you understand how MediCLI manages `Patients`/`Doctors`, you will also understand how it manages `Appointments`.
* Some differences are however inevitable and have been listed below:
  * `Appointment` objects include `doctorNric`, `patientNric` as attributes. A `Doctor` and `Patient` with the corresponding NRIC number must already exist before the `Appointment` was created.
  * `Appointments` are stored in a separate list in the backend, called the `UniqueAppointmentList`, to allow for different operations and flexibility down the line.
  * In terms of the UI, `Appointments` appear in a separate column to ensure that the user is able to clearly distinguish between them.


#### Alternatives considered
* One key alternative we looked at was storing `Appointment` objects with `Patient` and `Doctor` objects as part of the same list i.e. `UniquePersonList`.
* This would mean changing the `Person` class to a different one such as `Entry` and have all three of `Patient` , `Doctor` and `Appointment` extend from the `Entry` class.
* We decided against this because we thought that it was not the most OOP friendly solution and would not allow for flexibility down the line.
  * Eg: what if we wanted to add a feature that showed all `Appointments` for a set of `Patients` between a set of dates? Having them in the same list would be unintuitive and make the filtration and display quite cumbersome.
* Furthermore, it might get confusing for the user if everything was dumped into the same list for them to sieve through. Perhaps the user was only concerned with looking up `Patients` in which case the `Appointments` would simply be added clutter.
* The increased level of integration would also be problems for implementation and testing as existing functionality would have to be adapated, exposing the system to more risks and potential for bugs.
  * Eg: the class in question would have to change from `Person` to `Entry` in a number of different places.

### Understanding how MediCLI executes different types of commands
MediCLI currently supports four main types of functionality, namely: add, edit, query, and delete. Each of these functionalities are supported for both people (patient & doctor) and appointments through different command words.
However, different commands of the same functionality are analougous to each other to enhance readablity and expandability.
Furthermore, all of the commands extend the main `Command` class, thus the primary difference between each of them is within their `execute` methods. For their general implementation, please refer the "Logic component" section above.
This section will explore the implemention of the `execute` methods for each of the four functionalities.

#### Add Functionality
<i><b>Note</b>: Add `patient` and `doctor` has been grouped together as they are very similar in implementation.
This reduces repetition of information and increases clarity.</i>

Adds a new `Patient` or `Doctor` entry by indicating their `NRIC`, `Name`, `DoB`, and `Phone`.
This command is implemented through the `AddPatientCommand` for patient and `AddDoctorCommand` for doctor class which both extend the `Command` class.

Add command execution sequence:
* Step 1. The `execute` method of the `AddPatientCommand` is called.
* Step 2. The method calls the `hasPerson` method of `Model` to check if there are any duplicate patients.
  * If there is a duplicate person, the method throws `CommandException` and calls the `log` method of `logger` to log the incident.
* Step 3. The `addPerson` method of `Model` is then called and the control is passed back to the `execute` method.
* Step 4. The `log` method of `logger` is then called to log the successful command execution.
* Step 5. A new `CommandResult` object with the success message is then created and returned by `execute`.

This is the sequence of command execution for `execute` in `AddPatientCommand`, however `AddDoctorCommand` and `AddAppointmentCommand` follow similar design patterns within the execute command.
<img src="images/AddPatientCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

#### Edit Functionality

Edits a `doctor` or `patient` entry by indicating their `Index`.
This command is implemented through the `EditCommand` class which extends the `Command` class.

This is the sequence of command execution for `execute` in `EditCommand`, however `EditAppointmentCommand` follow a similar design pattern within the `execute` command.
* Step 1. The `execute` method of the `EditCommand` is called.
* Step 2. The method calls the `getFilteredPersonList` method of `Model` and returns the list.
* Step 3. The command checks whether the index of the command is valid by comparing the value returned by the `getZeroBased` method of `index` to the size of the list.
  * If the index is invalid, the command throws `CommandException`.
* Step 4. The `createEditedPerson` method is called and returns a new edited person.
* Step 5. The method calls the `hasPerson` method of `Model` to check if there are any duplicate persons.
  * If there are duplicates, the command throws `CommandException`.
* Step 6. The `setPerson` method of `Model` is called and control is then passed back to the `execute` method.
* Step 7. The `updateFilteredPersonList` method of `Model` is called to update the list.
* Step 8. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is then created and returned by `execute`.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates the command execution steps for `execute` method in `EditCommand`.

<img src="images/EditCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

#### Querying Functionality
This section describes the general sequence for commands that query entities. MediCLI has 5 different commands that serve this function: `find`, `patient`, `doctor`, `apptforpatient` and `apptfordoctor`.
Although this section describes only the `patient` command, each of the other commands, while lined with different predicates and have different requirements for their parameters, possesses similar implementation. Hence, the flow of method calls between classes are generally similar, and all 5 commands that query entities are described here together in one section.

* Step 1. The `execute()` method is called in an instance of `QueryPatientCommand`.
* Step 2. The instance of `QueryPatientCommand` calls the `updateFilteredPersonList()` method with the `PatientContainsKeywordsPredicate` in an instance of the `Model` class, which filters out entries and returns only patients that match the keywords entered. Note that the other commands listed here will have their respective `predicate` requirements and implementations.
* Step 3. Control is passed to an instance of the `Logger` class, which calls the method `log()` to log a "Success" message.
* Step 4. The instance of `QueryPatientCommand` calls the constructor method of the `CommandResult` class, which returns the final result.
* Step 5. Control is returned to the caller with the final result.

The sequence diagram below describes the interaction between the various components during the `execute` method of the `patient` command, which uses the `QueryPatientCommand` on the backend.

<img src="images/QueryPatientCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

Why is this implemented this way?
1. All query command closely resembles the structure of the `find` command. Each of the commands here have either stricter (i.e have stricter parameter requirements e.g `apptforpatient` and `apptfordoctor`) or looser (i.e searching for more fields e.g `patient` and `doctor`) predicates, but all generally have the same flow of control between the `Command`, `Logger` and `Model` classes.
2. Conceptually, each of the 5 commands listed here are searching for different entities, and are hence split into separate commands despite having very similar structures.

Alternative implementations considered
1. The behaviour of `patient` and `doctor`, `apptforpatient` and `apptfordoctor` have similar requirements in terms of parameters, with the main difference being either `patient` or `doctor` typed classes. We might consider combining each pair into one command, and using flags to distinguish the desired class (e.g a -doctor or -patient flag to indicate we wish to search for only `doctor` and `patient` entries respectively) so as to avoid the need to create additional commands. However, we felt that at the time of implementation, separating the commands would be a cleaner strategy, and combining methods might overcomplicate the implementation.
2. Even if we did proceed with combining, the combined command was to be overloaded with flags, we foresaw that the creation of distinct commands to fit the flags parsed were unavoidable. As such, it was prudent to start with the implementation of the distinct commands first, and leave the possibility of combining as a later increment.

#### Delete Functionality

Deletes a `doctor` or `patient` entry by indicating their `Index`.
This command is implemented through the `DeleteCommand` class which extends the `Command` class.

* Step 1. The `execute` method of the `DeleteCommand` is called.
* Step 2. The `getFilteredPersonList` method of `Model` is called and finds its length.
* Step 3. The `getZeroBased` method of `Index` is called to convert the provided index to its zero-based equivalent.
* Step 4. The provided index is checked against the length of the current list of people.
  * If the provided index is out of bounds, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 4. The `deletePerson` method of `Model` is called to remove the designated person from the list of people.
* Step 5. An instance of `CommandResult` is created with a success message for the execution of `DeleteCommand`.
* Step 6. The instance of `CommandResult` is returned.

The sequence diagram below closely describes the interaction between the various components during the `execute` method of `DeleteCommand`.

<img src="images/DeleteCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

### Incorrect user input handling process
In this section, we will use the _add_ commands for `patients`/`doctors` and `appointments` to demonstrate how MediCLI handles incorrect inputs from the user. 

#### Incorrect input handling process for commands that involve operations on the `Person` class
The activity diagram below demonstrates this incorrect input handling process of a command that operates on the `Person` class.
Specifically, we look at the process of adding a `Person` to MediCLI i.e. `addpatient` or `adddoctor` commands, potential mistakes that the user might make, and how they are handled by MediCLI.

<img src="images/AddPersonActivityDiagram.png" width="800" />

As visible, an incorrect input by the user can result in the following types of errors depending on the type of mistake:
- **Command word is incorrect**: informs the user that command word is unowkown.
- **Missing required field arguments**: informs the user of invalid command format. 
- **Invalid field arguments**: highlights to the user that invalid field arguments were provided.
- **`Patient`/`Doctor` with corresponding attributes already exists in the system**: informs the user that `Patient`/`Doctor` already exists in the system.


#### Incorrect user input handling process for the `Appointment` class
The activity diagram below demonstrates this incorrect input handling process of a command that operates on the `Appointment` class.
Specifically, we look at the process of adding an `Appointment` to MediCLI i.e. `addappt` command, potential mistakes that the user might make, and how they are handled by MediCLI.

<img src="images/AddAppointmentActivityDiagram.png" width="800" />

As visible, an incorrect input by the user can result in the following types of errors depending on the type of mistake:
- **Command word is incorrect**: informs the user that command word is unowkown
- **Missing required field arguments**: informs the user of invalid command format
- **Invalid field arguments**: highlights to the user that invalid field arguments were provided
- **`Patient`/`Doctor` involved in the `Appointment` does not exist in MediCLI**: informs the user that `Patient`/`Doctor` involved are not registered
- **Provided date & time of the `Appointment` is in the past**: informs the user that appointments cannot be scheduled in the past.
- **`Appointment` with corresponding attributes already exists in MediCLI**: informs the user that `Appointment` already exists

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature


#### Proposed Implementation


The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedMediCLI`. It extends `MediCLI` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `MediCLIStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:


* `VersionedMediCLI#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current MediCLI state in its history.

* `VersionedMediCLI#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous MediCLI state from its history.

* `VersionedMediCLI#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone MediCLI state from its history.


These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitMediCLI()`, `Model#undoMediCLI()` and `Model#redoMediCLI()` respectively.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.


Step 1. The user launches the  application for the first time. The `VersionedMediCLI` will be initialized with the initial MediCLI state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single MediCLI state.


![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)


Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the MediCLI. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitMediCLI()`, causing the modified state of the MediCLI after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `MediCLIStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.


![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)


Step 3. The user executes `addpatient i/S1234567A n/John Doe d/2003-01-30 p/98765432` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitMediCLI()`, causing another modified MediCLI state to be saved into the `MediCLIStateList`.


![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitMediCLI()`, so the MediCLI state will not be saved into the `MediCLIStateList`.


</div>


Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoMediCLI()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous MediCLI state, and restores the MediCLI to that state.


![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial MediCLI state, then there are no previous MediCLI states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoMediCLI()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather

than attempting to perform the undo.


</div>


The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:


![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


</div>


Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:


![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)


The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoMediCLI()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the MediCLI to that state.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `MediCLIStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest MediCLI state, then there are no undone MediCLI states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoMediCLI()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.


</div>


Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the MediCLI, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitMediCLI()`, `Model#undoMediCLI()` or `Model#redoMediCLI()`. Thus, the `MediCLIStateList` remains unchanged.


![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)


Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitMediCLI()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `MediCLIStateList`, all MediCLI states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `addpatient i/S1234567A n/John Doe d/2003-01-30 p/98765432` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.


![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:


<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />


#### Design considerations:


**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**


* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire MediCLI.

  * Pros: Easy to implement.

  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.


* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by

  itself.

  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).

  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* hospital clerks who deal with hospital related registration/administrative/management tasks
* has a need to manage a significant number of client details (patients/doctors/appointments)
* deals with many real time live updates, some being time-critical
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast and accurately
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 

MediCLI is a hospital management system that offers clerks the ability to execute querying/updating/creating/deleting commands faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven hospital management system, significantly speeding up the data entry/update/retrieval process.

As clerks likely execute many such commands each day, this offers a significant amount of time savings when considered on the whole. While this would be beneficial in any situation, this is especially important in a hospital setting where the stakes are much higher, and staff are required to perform at a very high level of efficiency with limited room for error

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty level:
If AB3 was at a difficulty level of 5/10, `MediCLI` reached was at a level of 8/10. This is most significantly because of the following reasons:
- Expansion of `Person` entity type to include `Patient` and `Doctor` entities.
- Inclusion of a completely new `Appointment` entity type.

The expansion into `Patient` and `Doctor` required us to expand the suite of commands to account for them, as well as modify the backend methods to account for the changes.
However, the `Appointment` class required us to build a completely new parallel infrastructure from UI to the commands to the storage and significantly increased the challenge and difficulty of the project.

### Challenges faced:
We faced multiple challenges in the project, most significant of which are highlighted below:
- Developing the `Appointments` feature: As a completely new entity type, we had to build this from the ground up while also integrating it the best way we could with the existing AB3 codebase, which was a big challenge. Even simple things like the `addAppointment` command required a large amount of implementation effort. Beyond just the functional code, writing tests for this and making sure that a sufficient portion was tested using automated tests was quite difficult as we had no existing code that we could build off-of, or modify.
- Achieving sufficient test coverage - as we have a fairly large amount of functional LOC written, a natural consequence is that we had to write a lot of test code to ensure that they were sufficiently tested. This was a challenge, especially in the beginning when we were just familiarising ourselves with automated tests.
- UI enhancements: As `javafx` was a completely new framework for everyone in our team, we found it rather difficult to actually make the UI enhancements that we wanted. Particularly we had to make a completely new `card` for appointments and we made changes to the general look and feel to make it more suitable for a hospital, which was a significant step away from the AB3 UI, hence the difficulty. 
- Finally, another difficulty we faced was actually considering the edge-cases and various scenarios that may arise from interactions between the different entities we were managing:
  - Let's say you have a `Doctor` with multiple `Appointments`, what do you do if the user deletes the `Doctor` from MediCLI? We decided that the most appropriate approach would be to recursively delete all `Appointments` associated with the doctor.
  - Similarly, what if you want to add an `Appointment` but the `Patient` involved doesn't exist in the records? We had to implement checks to prevent this.
  - Many other similar issues resulting from the interactions of different entities were noted and we found it quite challenging to actually identify and resolve all of them so they didn't become a bug or feature flaw down the line.

### Effort required:
In the previous sections we have already elaborated a little on the challenges and difficulties and talked about the efforts we put into addressing them. As such, for this section we have focused on quantifying the overall project effort.

On the whole, the project took us the entire duration that was offered, with most of us writing upwards of 1000 lines of functional code. The `Appointments` feature was naturally the biggest cause of this and it led to a number of issues that were quite effort-intensive to resolve. 
On a weekly basis, each of us invested about 8 hours on average in writing code, writing automated tests, documenting and manually testing the feature. 

For team meetings, we would meet up twice a week, one time at the start to distribute work for the week and discuss deliverables, and one time in the end to wrap up the milestone/work for the week and submit the deliverables. Altogether we spent about 3 hours in meetings per week. 

### Achievements:
Some achievements we are particulary proud of are:
- Robustness of `Appointments` feature: We tried to consider all the edge cases and problematic aspects of this and preemptively prevent them to make sure the user has a seamless experience.
- UI improvements: We are quite happy with the way `Appointments` and `Patients`/`Doctors` are integrated into the same window to allow for easy visualisation with minimal use of the mouse. We are also quite proud of the new clean and minimalist interface which we think reflects a hospital setting quite well.
- Variety of commands: We also are happy with the suite of commands that we offer to users. We focused on the most high-impact commands and ensured that our product offers all CRUD capabilities such that it may actually be used in a functional setting for a small clinic/hospital.
- Comprehensive testing: While we do not claim to be bug-free, we did a comprehensive amount of testing including testing our product ourselves manually, through automated tests, and even asking other teams to perform their own UAT on our product to identify pain-points/bugs/feature flaws (that we went on to address).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

The MediCLI development team (consisting of 5 members) acknowledges the presense of known feature flaws in our system.
Thus, we have planned the following 10 enhancements to be added in the near future.
Please find them organised into their respective categories.

### Appointment Functionality Enhancements

<span>1</span>. Adding an end time to appointments

Currently, the MediCLI system only stores the date and start time of an appointment.
However, we recognise that in a fast-paced environment like a hospital, it'd be beneficial to also be able to indicate an end time for appointments.
This is so that the doctor can be safely booked by another patient without worrying about potential clashes in appointment timings.
* <b>Updated Command Format</b> - `addappt sdt/STARTDATETIME [edt/ENDDATETIME] dn/DOCTORNRIC pn/PATIENTNRIC`
* <b>Example Input</b> - `addappt sdt/2024-05-20 10:00 edt/2024-05-20 11:00 dn/S1234567A pn/S1234567B`

<span>2</span>. More robust appointment timing validation.

Currently, the MediCLI system allows two appointments with the same doctor/patient and date-time to be simultaneously stored in the system.
However, it is clearly impossible for a patient or doctor to attend two different appointments at the same time.
Thus, we plan to implement a more robust appointment validation system to ensure that appointments with clashing or unrealistic timings can not be entered.

<span>3</span>. Marking old appointments as completed.

Even though the MediCLI system does not allow appointments to be made in the future, it nonetheless retains entry of completed appointments.
However, there is currently no visual distinction between future, completed, and missed appointments. This can be rather confusing for the hospital clerks.
Thus, we plan to add a label (just like the patient/doctor labels) in the top right corner of each appointment card to help better distinguish them.
* <b>New Command Format</b> - `markappt index s/STATUS` (`STATUS` can be any one of {`completed`, `missed`})
* <b>Example Input</b> - `markappt 1 s/completed`
* <b>Example Input</b> - `markappt 2 s/missed`

### Parameter Checking Enhancements

<span>4</span>. Accommodate names with symbols and/or special characters.

The name parameter is currently restricted to just alphabetical characters and white-space.
However, we recognise the existence of names that contain symbols and other special characters.
In the future, we plan to implement a more accommodating constraint that allows UTF-8 characters instead.
This means that names of other languages will be accepted as well.

<span>5</span>. Allow foreign patients/doctors to be added to the system.

The current constraints for the NRIC and phone number parameters reflect the Singaporean format.
However, we recognise that for foreign users, this can be rather limiting.
Thus, in the future, we plan on introducing more refined parameter checking that allows international NRIC and phone number formats.

<span>6</span>. Ensure each person being added to the system is unique.

While the current MediCLI system already checks to ensure every person added is unique, it is only done by comparing the NRIC of the person.
However, this should not be the only checking condition. Two entries with the same name, date of birth, and/or phone number should also be flagged as non-unique.
Thus, we will devise a more holistic assessment criterion to ensure no duplicates are allowed.

### User Interface Enhancements

<span>7</span>. Refine the user interface when the window size is minimised.

The current MediCLI system is not particularly flexible when it comes to window sizing.
Users on smaller screens may encounter the issue of scrolling being disabled or labels being truncated if a long name is entered.
In the future, we plan to make the UI more adaptive and friendly to smaller screens.

<span>8</span>Standardise displayed information.

For certain fields, the MediCLI system simply displays the text exactly as entered by the user.
However, this can introduce inconsistencies in capitalisation (especially with the NRIC field) when displayed in the user interface.
We plan on standardising these fields by automatically capitalising the users' input.

### Feature Enhancements

<span>9</span>. More advanced search options

Currently, the `find`, `patient`, and `doctor` commands return all entries whose details contain any of the given keywords.
However, this implementation is not particularly effective if the user would like to search for a person that matches all the provided keywords exactly
(e.g. when searching for a person by full name). In the future, we plan to add more advanced search options to allow for easy querying of information.
* <b>Updated Command Format</b> - `find t/TYPE KEYWORD`, `patient t/TYPE KEYWORD`, `doctor t/TYPE KEYWORD` (`TYPE` can be any one of {`full`, `partial`}).
* <b>Example Input</b> - `find t/full John Doe`
* <b>Example Input</b> - `doctor t/partial Smith Li`

<span>10</span>. More detailed error messages.

Some of the current error messages are not the most informative
(e.g. If two patient NRICs are provided when creating an appointment, the system only prompts `This appointment is invalid due to invalid inputs.`).
To decrease the learning curve for our system, we plan to replace all ambiguous error messages with more informative versions, e.g. `Please make sure the NRIC provided belongs to a person of the correct type as indicated by the prefix.`.
